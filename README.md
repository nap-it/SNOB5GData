# SNOB-5G Data

This repository contains data acquired in a real mmWave Wigig-compliant network. The network is composed of three Metnet 60G nodes deployed in an outdoor environment following the architecture shown in the following figure.

The multi-layer data includes information for all mmWave links for different modulation and coding schemes (MCS) modes: (i) constant mode (1, 3,242
5, 7 and 9); (ii) dynamic adjustment according to the channel variations. Moreover, it includes information regarding the behavior of the multi-layer metrics under three distinct scenarios, according to the type and duration of the blockage event crossing the LOS path. These scenarios can be described as follows:

 Markup : * Normal scenario: metrics were collected during 15 minutes in a non-obstructed propagation environment
 Markup : * Long-term blocked scenario: metrics were collected during 15 minutes under continuous LOS blockage caused by the static metallic obstacle shown in Figure above
 Markup : * Short-term blocked scenario: metrics were collected during 5 minutes in the presence of human blockages that cause temporary LOS blockage during short periods of time
